# Would You Rather Udacity Project

This is the 'Would you Rather Web Application' for the Udacity React-Redux Course. It should be noted that this project uses Stephen Grider's BoilerPlate code for begining the project with react and redux already prepared. All subsequent code and changes were made by me.
Stephen Grider's starter react-redux git repository can be found here:
```
https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
```

### Getting Started

To get started Run these commands after cloning the dirctory and navigating into it:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
It should also be noted that you must go to http://localhost:8080/ even though on npm install it says to go to 
 http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

### Known Issues
```
1.Routing works when you go to http://localhost:8080/ instead of http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
despite what it says when you run the project
```

```
2. The Styling isn't great on this, but the focus of this project is to become familiar with React-Redux
