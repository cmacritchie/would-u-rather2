# Would You Rather Udacity Project

This is the 'Would you Rather Web Application' for the Udacity React-Redux Course. It should be noted that this project uses Stephen Grider's BoilerPlate code for begining the project with react and redux already prepared. All subsequent code and changes were made by me.
Stephen Grider's starter react-redux git repository can be found here:
```
https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
```

### Getting Started

To get started Run these commands after cloning the dirctory and navigating into it:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

### Known Issues
```
1. The first known issue is that that URL does not update upon clicking on different Routes. I've tried numerous times to fix this to no avail; however, typing in the route will take you to the component that you want.
```

```
2. The Styling isn't great on this, but the focus of this project is to become familiar with React-Redux
